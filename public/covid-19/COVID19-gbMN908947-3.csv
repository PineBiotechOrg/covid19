21563,25384,S,surface glycoprotein,,gb|QHD43416.1|,structural protein,"Surface glycoprotein (S). Spike protein S1 (residue 14-685): attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor, initiating the infection. Binding to human ACE2 and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR receptors and internalization of the virus into the endosomes of the host cell induces conformational changes in the S glycoprotein. Proteolysis by cathepsin CTSL may unmask the fusion peptide of S2 and activate membranes fusion within endosomes. Spike protein S2 (residue 686-1273): mediates fusion of the virion and cellular membranes by acting as a class I viral fusion protein. Under the current model, the protein has at least three conformational states: pre-fusion native state, pre-hairpin intermediate state, and post-fusion hairpin state. During viral and target cell membrane fusion, the coiled coil regions (heptad repeats) assume a trimer-of-hairpins structure, positioning the fusion peptide in close proximity to the C-terminal region of the ectodomain. The formation of this structure appears to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and target cell membranes. Spike protein S2' (residue 816-1273): acts as a viral fusion peptide which is unmasked following S2 cleavage occurring upon virus endocytosis."

26245,26472,E,envelope protein,E protein,gb|QHD43418.1|,structural protein,"E. Plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly. Acts as a viroporin and self-assembles in host membranes forming pentameric protein-lipid pores that allow ion transport. Also plays a role in the induction of apoptosis. Activates the host NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1beta overproduction."

28274,29533,N,nucleocapsid phosphoprotein,,gb|QHD43423.2|,structural protein,N. Packages the positive strand viral genome RNA into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) and plays a fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M. Plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication.
